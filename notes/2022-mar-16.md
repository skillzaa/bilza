# creating Grid component again


- i decided that it is better just to use one style in your module. we can create one style for each item with in component (eg in case of grid 1 style for lines and 1 style for numbers) and at times it may be better 
BUT
we can also save lineWidth in a variable and update the 1 global style before drawing that item.==> This seems better
