<h1>Insert</h1>

We create component from ComponentFactory. However once they are created they need to be inserted into Bilza engine. <br>
Following are some of the methods being used currently. There may be more later. 

<h3>Insert Methods</h3>
<ol> 
<li><h3>add(comp :IComponent,startTime :number,duration :number)</h3></li>
Using bil.add() is the main way to add components to Bilza engine. We provide a startTime and duration at which the component is loaded and unloaded (a component is always visible just between its startTime and endTime). <br>
<small>Component endTime is calculated as startTime + duration. It means that whenever we move the startTime the endTime also changes automatically.</small>
If the component endTime (startTime + duration) is larger than the current length of animation ( bil.len() ) the extra time (overlap) will be added to the animation length. <br>
Keep in mind that the second argument is duration and not endTime. If you want to load a component at 10 sec and want to run it for 10 sec the correct way is : <br>
bil.add(compName,10,10); // CORRECT <br>
bil.add(compName,10,20); // WRONG <br>

<li><h3>append(comp :IComponent,duration :number)</h3></li>
When we append a component it is added to the last of run queue and will start running after all the components loaded before it have run. <br>
We need append since most of the presentations are made in modules and those module are put together like lego pieces to form an animation. <br>
We want all the module to be loaded one by one so we append them. <br>

<li><h3>alwaysOn(comp:IComponent)</h3></li>
Components which are loaded with alwaysOn are sdisplayed from the start of animation to its end. <br>
One example is the "grid" component that needs to be loaded in an animation from start to end. <br>
Another such example can be frameCounter component that needs to be loaded in an animation from start to end. <br>
