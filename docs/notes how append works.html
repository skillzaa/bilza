<h4>How InsertOption Append works</h4>
<p>When we set the <b>insertOption</b> of a component to Append then when ever it is inserted into bilza the component is added at the tail of current clips cue. <i>It means that the bilza engine will set the startTime of the component (using setStartTime()) Equal to the current duration of the video and after than will extend the video duration by the duration of the clip.</i> </p>
<p>For Append to work all we need is duration larger than 0. <b>If the duration is less than or equal to 0 the Append operation will not work</b></p>
