> Bilza.js is a javascript framework for creating business and educational visualizations in the browser using HTML5 canvas.
---
# Lot..lot..lot..lot of new components are coming by end next month (July-2022)
# Complete documentation and examples will be added with in next 1 week (by approx 10-Jun-2022)
## Mission
To be an easy to use library for creating 
    - Presentations.
    - Slides with text, images and other components (with some basic    animation and effects).
    - Demo videos, tutorials etc.
    - Lessons and educational content.

## What Bilza is Not
 - Bilza is NOT fast, can be running it on even low frame rate.
 - Bilza is not an animation framework. It actually has very basic animation features.
 - Bilza is not a game engine. Please keep this in mind, the purpose is to make slides, presentations, demo videos etc
 - The output code is simple javascript which will draw its content on a HTML5 canvas.
- Bilza is not (yet) interactive (since its a lot of work, may be some day).

## Installation

> npm install bilza

### What is a Component 

> A component is what bilza library consumes. The only objective of bilza library is to draw components on the screen. That means that bilza library is extended through components.

###### At the moment some very basic components have been added like "Text" and "Grid".

**This library is still in early stages and is error prone. You should play with it but wait till version 1.0.0 for serious use.**


If you want to be in touch or send me a bug report please use github issues.
I will add some tests and then improve documentations.
