## What Bilza is Not
 - Bilza is NOT fast, currently I am running it on 1 frame per second which by any animation standerds is as low as it gets.
 - Bilza is not an animation framework.
 - Bilza is not a game engine.
 - The output code is simple javascript which will draw its content on a HTML5 canvas.
- Bilza is not interactive (since its a lot of work, may be some day).

## Installation

> npm install bilza

### What is a Component 

> A component is what bilza library consumes. The only objective of bilza library is to draw components on the screen. That means that bilza library is extended through components.

###### At the moment some very basic components have been added like "Text" and "Grid".

**This library is still in early stages and is error prone. You should play with it but wait till version 1.0.0 for serious use.**


If you want to be in touch or send me a bug report please use github issues.
I will add some tests and then improve documentations.
