# What is Bilza

---
> A Javascript Animation Engine for creating responsive animations on HTML5 Canvas.
---


# Philosophy Behind Bilza.js

1. I think that in year 2022 creating complex animations in Javascript should not be a black art. <b>Any body who has basic javascript knowledge should be able to create animations.</b>

1. There are many content types (e.g educational slides, business presentations etc) which we want to be presented like a video but should be edit-able like normal text (or a power point presentation). Incase of video format;  editing is very expensive and time consuming. On the other hand editing a javascript animation is just editing few commands.

1. Incase you want your message / presentation to reach millions of viewers and the message is in videos format: the file size will be atleast 2-10 Mb (and this is on the lowest side). Imgaine how many people will be reluctant to download such a heavy file or to share it. On the other hand a javascript animation is very light weight as compared to video format.  A javascript animation carrying the same message may have a filesize of few kilo Bites. The heaviest thing in a javascript animation is the sound file. 

1. You can share javascript animation just like you share a link to an html file. It can be hosted free of cost on github.

1. One of the things that I want to achieve is that:: Since the final output is a javascript file and once you have packed your presentation there should be no outer dependency for it. There should be  nothing out of the single file that can break and crash your animation. As long as browsers support javascript your animation should run. <b>BUT</b> The images and sound files that you use are external reasources and if they go missing your animation will not work. We can make effort to convert images and sound files also into Javascript BUT a better option is to bind them using an html file just like we have been doing for so many years on the web. 

1. Creating Responsive Animations: The single main "pain point" of creating javascript animation is <b> creating responsive animations</b>. We like to create animations but we also want them to fit on to the many screen sizes. For this the bilza.js has been written with responsiveness in mind and (almost) every thing grow and shrink according to the screen size. All the x and y coordinated and the width and height values are in percentages of the current canvas size and are drawn according. 

1. Animation is code and Code is Reusable : One of the basic purpose of this library is to enable users to stitch together small pieces of animation and create complex animations.

1. It is not morally and ethically correct for any developer / app to hold the data of its users as hostage. The hard work and effort that a user has put into creating an animation makes him the creator and owner of that animation. <i> An app / lib should allow its users to download their data in a user firendly format</i>. For this I wil make sure that there is always some command present in the library (working on it currently) which should enable the user to get their animation data in json format so that if they like they can use it else-where.  



# What Will Bilza.js Enable you to do ?

1. <i>Bilza.js will enable you to create Javascript animation that behave like a video</i>. You can "play", "pause", "stop" the animation just like a video. You can also "skip forward" ,  "skip backward" or draw any random frame from inbetween the animation. You can also go to any frame and save that as an image.

1. <i>Bilza.js will enable you to create slide (presentations, lesson plans ,sales Pitch, advertisements etc)</i> and then share them with who ever you like. The final product is a simple javascript file that will run in any (decent) browser anywhere. There is NO installation NO plugins and NO dependencies (on any other library). This will enable your clients to consume your content with out any hassle.


1. <i>Bilza.js will enable you to create web based advertisement videos (animation) and embed them into your website or your client websites. Animated graphics are always prefered over still ones.</i>

1. <i>Bilza.js will enable your to insert animation in your "notes", "web posts" , "blog posts" or other client projects</i>. You can make simple animations for explaining your point and that will make your content far richer and attractive that normal text. Incase you are working for a client they will also welcome animated content.

1. <i>Bilza.js can help you in creating viral content</i>. To create viral content we need animation but we want to make the file size as small as possible since downloading large content is what costs money to your customers. In this scenario light weight javascript animations seems like the best candidate.

1. <i>Bilza.js will enable you in create animations that will always run everywhere (in browser)</i>. Once you have created an animation with a version of bilza.js that animation with that version of bilza will always run on any browser since there is nothing to break between your animation and its execuation. There is No outer dependecies of libraries that can crash or inject virus etc.

1. <i>Bilza.js will enable you to create responsive animations which will resize themselves according to the current screen size</i>. Your content can be viewed on many screen sizes and will draw responsively.

# Basic Feature
---
- <strong>Ease of use</strong> : <b>This library has no dependencies.</b>. It also has no installations, built systems etc. Is usable with any project. Even primitive JavaScript knowledge is enough to start using it.

- <strong>Responsiveness</strong> : The drawings and animations will resize its self according to the host screen size. (The most difficult part of this library).
- <strong>Composable Animations</strong> : The library will try to provide more and more tools to enable the creator to compose larger animations using smaller animation like LEGO pieces. 
- <strong>Behave like a Video</strong> : This library is written with an intention that the animation should behave more like a normal video.
