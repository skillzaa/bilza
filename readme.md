# What is Bilza.js

---
> Bilza.js is a javascript framework for creating business and educational visualizations in the browser using HTML5 canvas.
---

## Mission
To be an easy to use library for creating 
    - Presentations.
    - Slides with text, images and other components (with some basic    animation and effects).
    - Demo videos, tutorials etc.
    - Lessons and educational content.

## What Bilza is Not
 - Bilza is NOT fast, can be running it on even low frame rate.
 - Bilza is not an animation framework. It actually has very basic animation features.
 - Bilza is not a game engine. Please keep this in mind, the purpose is to make slides, presentations, demo videos etc
 - The output code is simple javascript which will draw its content on a HTML5 canvas.
- Bilza is not (yet) interactive (since its a lot of work, may be some day).

## Installation

> npm install bilza

### How Bilza Works
+ You create a component
+ You set component properties, attach animations to it etc etc.
+ You insert the component into the engine.
+ You start the engine.

> A component is what bilza library consumes. The only objective of bilza library is to draw components on the screen. That means that bilza library is extended through components.

###### At the moment some very basic components have been added like "Text" and "Grid".
