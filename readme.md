### This version is release candidate. The API is reasonably mature and I hope there will be no breaking changes in it.

### How Bilza Works
+ You create a component
+ You set component properties, attach animations to it etc etc.
+ You insert the component into the engine.
+ You start the engine.

<small> A component is what bilza library consumes. The only objective of bilza library is to draw components on the screen. That means that bilza library is extended through components.</small>

## What Bilza is Not

 - Bilza is NOT fast, it can run on as low as 1 frame per second.
 - Bilza is not a game engine.
 - Bilza is not (yet) interactive (since its a lot of work, may be some day).
