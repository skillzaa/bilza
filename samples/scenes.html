<h1>Bilza.js : Creating Scenes</h1>

<blockquote>A Scene is a collection of Components grouped together by same entry and exit time.</blockquote>

<p>By now you must know that in Bilza.js you create components and then add them to bilza engine to create animations. However once you have added large number of components it becomes very difficult to manage them all. We need a system in which we can group components that we want to be on the screen at the same time. For this purpose we have <b>Screne Object</b> in Bilza.js</p>

<p>Any artist while planning his/her animation divides it into different scenes. This is exactly how we will do it in Bilza.js. All the components that we want to be visible at same time are placed in one scene. Once all the scenes are made the Artist will stich them together to make the final animation.</p>

<p>For example if one is creating a business presentation, he can divide his presentation in to slides and each slide becomes one scene. After that all the scenes / slides are inserted into the main animation.</p>

<p>The ability to create scenes also allow us to create ready-made reasources that we can just insert and use with very little change.</p>

<h2>Some Important Points about Scenes</h2>

<ol>
    <li> <b>The main purpose of a scene is to collect components and make sure that their start and end time stays with in the start and end time of the scene.</b>. When we create a scene the first 2 arguments are always its start time and end time with in the main animation.</li>
    
    <li>If we give 2 scenes same time or overlapping timings that is not an error the scenes will just overlap.</li>
    
    <li>If we insert a scene which is larger than the current length of animation the animation will extend its length to accommodate the scene (just like a component).</li>
    
    <li>To insert scenes we use "bil.insert.addScene" command. Internally this is just like a batch "bil.insert.add" command which just loads in a large number of components into the engine.</li>

    
    <li>With in the scene when we add components we have to give them start time and end time according to the start time and end time of the scene. Any component with in a scene can not have start time smaller than the scene start time or larger end time than the end time of the scene. For example if a scene start time is 5 and end time is 50. There can not be a component in this scene that has a start time smaller than 5 or end time larger than 50.</li>

    <li>All the components inside a scene do not need to enter and exit at the same time with the scene. Scene Components can have their own entry and exit time but with in the bounds of the scene start and end time.Since the start and end timings of components with in a scene are in relationship to scene start and end time so when we insert a scene at some specific start and end time all the start and end timings of the components contained in that scene also gets translated <i>(It simply means that the entry and exit time of a component inside a scene depends upon the scene and remains the same with respect to the scene)</i>.</li>

    <li>To make sure that while creating components in a scene we do not add timings to these components which are out of the bound of scene timings the "scene.add" command take in component start time and end time BUT the start time is ADDED to the scene start time and the end time is SUBTRACTED from the scene end time. It means that If we want to add a component that Enters and Exits with the scene its start time will be 0 and its end time will be also 0.</li>
</ol>
