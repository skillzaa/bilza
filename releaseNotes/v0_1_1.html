<h1>Version 0.1.1</h1> 

<p>In the previous version we used to create components using Component Factory and then insert it into Bilza engine. Now that process is done internally thus eliminating one step from the process. This created breaking changes in the API but if we do not change the API in version 0 then when will we?</p>
<p>A new component CanvasBorder has been added.</p>
<p>The "Templates" just appear with Text component but in next version they will appear in almost all components.</p>
<p>There may be a lot of small error and bugs but overall the library is functional we have created over 100 working examples.</p>
<p>The Scenes Module has been added on experimental basis. In future this module is going to be the backbone of Bilza.js
