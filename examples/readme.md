# Rules

 1. Every file is html file and is self contained. There is no other file attached to it except **bilza.js**. There is no need to keep the template of each file the same, we can change it for every new file. It means that I can link my example to the main src bilza.js OR one of the version in dist folder (as I like no worries).

2. There can be one index.js file and one demo.html which will be used since we can not get context-sensitive help in .html file.

3. Keep it simple and do not complicate if needed I can create folders for each example.

4. Index file. There should be one single file where every example is listed.
