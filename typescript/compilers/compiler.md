## What is the Purpose of Compiler:
> Compiler collects all the data required for creating a videos and once it has that data it creates an animation using bilza engine.

- The compiler by default is designed to collect data and then analyze it in many iterations thus it can collect data as right-edge and bottom-edge since it gets resolved later.
- The user code and the bilza engine does not have to co-incide one-to-one the compiler will make many things esay.
- The compiler is an abolutely important module and musr for future.
- Compiler can create its own function which add objects as templates.

> The engine will be greatly simplified and become a real engine since it will work on simple numbers crunching and not logic. all the logic will be resolved by compiler. 
- All the responsive vs non responsive confusion is also move up to be solved at compiler level.

> The compiler wear bilza engine like a glove

The same compiler is what i tried to create in the UI project as recorder. The same compiler will also pring code base on its collected data.

- it is very easy to make compiler save more data than required for later use HERE the COMPILER FILE IS DIFFERENT THAN THE DISPLAY FILE.

- when ever we need to save more data we can do it in compiler since it has a recorder portion and a compiler portion. it is very easy to add more data to save. 

- this gives us wayyy more flexibility and thus we can make engine more strict.
