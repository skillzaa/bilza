# Modules
A module is what creates components internally and then spits out or run a bilzaa animation.
**This is a build system** 

## For example 
I can create a **Presentation** or **Slides** module. that will expose functions that can create headings lines images and also set their main properties with in the same function arguments.
Once we have fed it all the information along with FrameStart and FrameStop then we can ask it to spit out a bilzaa object that we can then run.
**It is like loading different videos** 
This module can then be use to create and generate
