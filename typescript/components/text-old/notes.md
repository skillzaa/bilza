Idea:
The HTML box system is just 4 rectangles nested into each other
- the margin
- the border
- the padding
- the content inside a contentArea.

Instead of using lines to draw border etc just use fill rentangles.
## The BoxSys is a base object that will be used to create other custom box system.
this is one of the core components of this app 
## Box system is a sub genra of components. for my use
