# the issue  :
- the current text component (is old BoxSys, may be that is a better name for it).
- this is a very low level component. we can use it to create a large number of similar components.
- This provides all sort of functionality, one can use it directly or can inheret from it and use it the way it feels better-

-- we can use it as pre-set templates
