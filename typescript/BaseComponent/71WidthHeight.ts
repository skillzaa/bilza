 * 15-july-2022 : content height and also content width will always return width and height prop (that every comp has) as per its percentage to the current canvas size if "responsiveDims == true" else just return raw number. 
 * This is the default behaviour of the component :: IF WE WANT TO OVER RIDE THIS BEHAVIOUR THEN OVERRIDE THE contentWidth and contentHeight methods.
 * Do not invent new props to denote width and height just every comp may apply them differently thus explain that there e.g in rawText width = fontSize;
 * Other than very special cases : Try that every comp should widen and shrink with width and height prop. IN RESPONSIVE AS WELL AS NON RESPONSIVE MODE. this is the core of this lib.
 * 16-july-2022 : added responsiveDims
