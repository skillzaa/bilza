- I am going to make a full featured component. it is no more just a wrapper over one pack draw function.
- I will use p.drawLines() to draw a triangle and the put in place all abstractions.
## Promise -- I will not add more features rather just do what the current version can.
## Features
    1. every line to have own style.
    2. draw circles on vertex
    3. fill or empty triangle.
## Overall picture
- i have a drawengine with transistions. this does not have animation capabilities for now.
- rather than concentrating on animation I should **develop component systems** for it like triangle, shapes, metrices, equations, language learning and other **eco system** around this.

# This is a life time project.    
## This document is done . it has served its purpose.

8. start with presentations for smaller children. make such content and increase frm there.
7. the transitions is the main thing do not thing about animations just use transitions for now. Transitions is first class feature of this engine.
8. just use data and transitions do not use style 
9. use Style internally privately do not expose them in component api. just use data and transitions.
